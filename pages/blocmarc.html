        <h1>Blocmarc</h1>
        <div class="center-text">
          <h3><span class="underline-white">Summary</span></h3>
          <p>Saving inspiration on the web can be difficult. Blocmarc wants to give users an easy way to create text and collect images and links so that they&rsquo;ll never forget an idea. I researched, designed and developed this prototype for my Bloc Designer Track project.</p>

          <h3><span class="underline">Problem</span></h3>
          <p>Most web apps for note taking are too complicated &ndash; there are more options than are necessary to record inspiration. The end result is a cluttered experience that makes finding content cumbersome and confusing. Blocmarc strives to give its users a simple, clean and effective way of saving ideas on the web.</p>

        <div class="probsol-right">
          <h3><span class="underline">Solution</span></h3>
          <p>Through comprehensive user research, competitive analysis and user testing we created Blocmarc: Never forget an idea. Our process (detailed in the next section) found that our users wanted a quick way create, save and share content (notes, checklists, images and links) on their mobile devices and computers.</p>

          <h3><span class="underline-white">Process</span></h3>
          <p>The path to Blocmarc consisted of a detailed and careful study of user research, competitive analysis, user personas, user stories/flows, wireframes, mockups, branding, prototypes and user testing &ndash; all with various iterations:</p>

        <h4><span class="process-tag" id="research-tag">User research highlights</span></h4>
        <div class="one-fourth research">
          <h5>86%</h5>
          <p>News (86%) and social networks (86%) are the most popular content types by a large margin.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-fourth research">
          <h5>78.6%</h5>
          <p>Browser access will be key for the success of Blocmarc as most respondents use their browsers to save content (78.6%). Many respondents commented that browser bookmarks can become cluttered and confusing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-fourth research">
          <h5>Sync</h5>
          <p>Respondents commented that they would like an app that could sync across platforms, offer better organization and the ability to check off notes &ndash; not delete &ndash; once they&rsquo;re finished.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-fourth research">
          <h5>85.7%</h5>
          <p>85.7% of respondents said they would be open to paying for a service that organized their digital documents. 77.8% of those willing to pay would commit $5-10 per month. </p>

          <h4><span class="process-tag">Competitive analysis</span></h4>
          <p>An analysis of market competitors Evernote, Google Keep and Quip found that Blocmarc&rsquo;s experience should be a sweet spot between Google Keep and Evernote. The easy interface and features of Keep combined with some of the Evernote features like hand-drawn notes and web clipper could meet that goal.</p>

        <div class="process-right">
          <h4><span class="process-tag">User personas</span></h4>
          <p>Three users with distinct roles were interviewed about their motivations, goals and frustrations. Save and searcher Alex often forgets that note-taking apps are availble without a browser widget. Distributor Mary would like a checklist function that tracks her progress. Gatherer-sharer Liz needs storage for large documents.</p>
