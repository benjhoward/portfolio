        <div class="center-text">
          <h3><span class="underline-white">Summary</span></h3>
          <p>Saving inspiration on the web can be difficult. Blocmarc wants to give users an easy way to create text and collect images and links so that they&rsquo;ll never forget an idea. I researched, designed and developed this prototype for my Bloc Designer Track project.</p>

          <h3><span class="underline">Problem</span></h3>
          <p>Most web apps for note taking are too complicated &ndash; there are more options than are necessary to record inspiration. The end result is a cluttered experience that makes finding content cumbersome and confusing. Blocmarc strives to give its users a simple, clean and effective way of saving ideas on the web.</p>

        <div class="probsol-right">
          <h3><span class="underline">Solution</span></h3>
          <p>Through comprehensive user research, competitive analysis and user testing we created Blocmarc: Never forget an idea. Our process (detailed in the next section) found that our users wanted a quick way create, save and share content (notes, checklists, images and links) on their mobile devices and computers.</p>

          <h3><span class="underline-white">Process</span></h3>
          <p>The path to Blocmarc consisted of a detailed and careful study of user research, competitive analysis, user personas, user stories/flows, wireframes, mockups, branding, prototypes and user testing &ndash; all with various iterations:</p>

        <div class="one-fourth research">
          <h5>86%</h5>
          <p>News (86%) and social networks (86%) are the most popular content types by a large margin.</p>

        <div class="one-fourth research">
          <h5>78.6%</h5>
          <p>Browser access will be key for the success of Blocmarc as most respondents use their browsers to save content (78.6%). Many respondents commented that browser bookmarks can become cluttered and confusing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-fourth research">
          <h5>Sync</h5>
          <p>Respondents commented that they would like an app that could sync across platforms, offer better organization and the ability to check off notes &ndash; not delete &ndash; once they&rsquo;re finished.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-fourth research">
          <h5>85.7%</h5>
          <p>85.7% of respondents said they would be open to paying for a service that organized their digital documents. 77.8% of those willing to pay would commit $5-10 per month. </p>

          <h4><span class="process-tag">Competitive analysis</span></h4>
          <p>An analysis of market competitors Evernote, Google Keep and Quip found that Blocmarc&rsquo;s experience should be a sweet spot between Google Keep and Evernote. The easy interface and features of Keep combined with some of the Evernote features like hand-drawn notes and web clipper could meet that goal.</p>

          <h4><span class="process-tag">User personas</span></h4>
          <p>Three users with distinct roles were interviewed about their motivations, goals and frustrations. Save and searcher Alex often forgets that note-taking apps are availble without a browser widget. Distributor Mary would like a checklist function that tracks her progress. Gatherer-sharer Liz needs storage for large documents.</p>

        <div class="process-left standalone-left">      
          <p>Before jumping into the design and layout of the app, we established the overall look and feel of the brand. That included choosing fonts for headlines and body type &ndash; Roboto Slab and Catamaran. Roboto was chosen for its versatility as it has a mechanical skeleton but features friendly and open curves. The hard angles of the font align with boxes and toy building blocks, which give the type face a playful characteristic. We chose this red color scheme mostly to differentiate Blocmarc from its competitors. Evernote is Green, Dropbox is blue and Google keep is yellow, so we wanted to stay away from those colors.</p>
